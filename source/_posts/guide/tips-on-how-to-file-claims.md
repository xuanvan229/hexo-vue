### (with dates of services September 1, 2015 and forward)

For billing of Amerigroup MMP patients - please bill Amerigroup as usual as VLIPA does not have contract for this line of business yet.

For billing Amerigroup CLASSIC (Medicare only) and SPECIALTY (Medicare + Medicaid) you will need to bill Van Lang IPA.  The electronic claims will go through our clearinghouse at www.freeclaims.com whose office is in Sugarland, Texas.   For Amerigroup members NOT associated with Van Lang IPA, please bill Amerigroup directly.

### ELECTRONIC CLAIMS

Each Provider will get an ID and password for the clearinghouse from Jeff Ngo, Manager of Provider Network Operations [jeff.ngo@vanlangipa.com].  Our payer ID for Freeclaims clearinghouse will be VLIPA.  There will be one submitter ID per Tax ID for the clearinghouse.

### PAPER CLAIMS

For those that cannot upload their claims to www.freeclaims.com because they use a billing company that won't do this (i.e. Athena), you will need to drop to paper.  We have already spoken to Athena so that this process to drop to paper will be easy.  To set up paper claims in Athena, see Appendix A.  Athena has also agreed to work with Van Lang IPA to send electronic claims but this will probably be a 2-3 months process, since they are busy with ICD10 conversion.

If you prefer, you can also fax us your claims.
