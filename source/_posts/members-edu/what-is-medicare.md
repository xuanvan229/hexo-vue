### The Four Parts of Medicare

There are four "parts" to your Medicare benefits:
Medicare "Part A" and "Part B" are often called "Original Medicare"
Medicare "Part C" is often called "Medicare Advantage" plans or "MA Plans"
Medicare "Part D" is often called "Prescription Drug Coverage"

### Medicare Part A
*Medicare Part A is hospital coverage*

Part A (also called Original Medicare) is managed by Medicare and provides Medicare benefits and coverage for:

* Inpatient hospital care
* Inpatient stays in most skilled nursing facilities
* Hospice and home health services
 
### Medicare Part B
*Medicare Part B is medical coverage*

Part B (also called Original Medicare) is managed by Medicare and provides Medicare benefits and coverage for:

* Doctor and clinical lab services
* Outpatient and preventive care
* Screenings, surgical fees and supplies
* Physical and occupational therapy

### Medicare Part C
*Medicare Part C combines both A and B*

Medicare Part C (also called Medicare Advantage) is a different way of getting Medicare Part A and Part B coverage. Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans combine Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance) together in one plan. They can also be combined with Part D prescription drug coverage creating a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) Plan. Generally, these plans are offered as:

* Medicare Advantage Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO plans)
* Medicare Advantage Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO plans)
* Medicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS plans)
* Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans (SNP plans)

### Medicare Part D
*Medicare Part D is Prescription Drug Coverage*

A Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) can be a stand-alone plan (not joined with other insurance) or it may be combined with a Medicare Advantage Plan, also called a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MA-PD) Plan.
